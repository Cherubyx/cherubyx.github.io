It's been a while since I last updated my site. 
In fact, it was 2016 when I was documenting some challenges I had with Xamarin, back at my first job out of university.

I was lost, I didn't know what to showcase on my site. 
There was so much white on one page. 
It was literally a developer's block similar to an artist's block or writer's block.

With the pandemic and everything else that's been thrown to us in 2020. 
I felt inclined to do something with my free time.
Why not remake my website, add some personal projects in and add my updates for them?

I'm excited for this new change.
