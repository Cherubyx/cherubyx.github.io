I assumed all developers have experienced this one moment at least once in their career. You know, that moment when you misplaced a single word in code and everything just breaks or doesn't work? No? Well I'm part of that wonderful dataset then and I think it's a perfectly normal mistake at 1 AM in the morning.

After installing **Yarn** ([a nice little package manager](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/)) without issues. I decided to try out **expo-cli** which helps simplify the process of starting a project in React Native quickly for mobile. I decided I would install it globally, so that I can access it everywhere from the terminal on my machine.

First I tried:
```
yarn add global expo-cli
```

Guess what this did? [Exactly what I didn't want. See the Note part.](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/global#toc-yarn-global)
TLDR: It added package names called **global** and **expo-cli** <ins>locally in the current directory</ins>, instead of installing `expo-cli` in a global environment.

Turns out the proper command was:
```
yarn global add expo-cli
```

Wonderful. Looking back at this right as I'm writing this down now, I would have loved to have that flag like a npm **`--global`** flag. Basically any other command line with dashes, like **`--version`** to make it more obvious. Oh well.
