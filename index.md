My name's Tiffany and I'm a mobile developer at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/).

Here are some quick fun facts:

* The Chinese text above is my Chinese name, you can pronounce it like "`Yip Man Yan`" in Cantonese [(listen)](https://www.bing.com/translator?ref=TThis&&text=&from=yue&to=en).
* I'm currently located in Canada 🇨🇦 but I love to travel.
* I accept any ☕, 🍵, or 🍣 [support](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/tiffanyip).

This blog contains my personal ramblings, observations and developer findings.
